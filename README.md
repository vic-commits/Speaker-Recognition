# Speaker Recognition  
This project focuses on applying **Fast Fourier Transforms (FFT)** to break down audio samples into wave components for feature extraction and speaker identification. The project leverages machine learning models, including Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), to classify speakers from a dataset of audio recordings.

## Introduction  
Speaker recognition is an essential technology for applications such as voice assistants, security systems, and telecommunication. This project uses FFT to decompose audio signals into frequency components, enabling the extraction of meaningful features for machine learning. By combining signal processing with neural networks, the model achieves reliable speaker identification.

## Features  
- **Fast Fourier Transform (FFT)**: Breaks audio samples into frequency domains.   
- **Deep Learning Model**: Utilizes a CNN to classify speakers efficiently.  
- **Data Augmentation**: Adds noise and modifies audio properties to improve generalization.

## Model Architecture  
The CNN processes extracted features (e.g., spectrograms):  
1. **Convolutional Layers**: Detects spatial patterns in frequency data.  
2. **Pooling Layers**: Reduces dimensionality while retaining key features.  
3. **Dense Layers**: Maps extracted features to speaker identities.

## Results  
- **Accuracy**: Achieved XX% accuracy on the test dataset.  
- **Visualization**: Example spectrograms and loss/accuracy plots can be found in `results/`.

## Future Work  
- Experiment with additional audio feature extraction techniques (e.g., Chroma, ZCR).  
- Explore alternative deep learning models like transformers or RNNs.  
- Deploy the system with a REST API for real-time speaker recognition.
